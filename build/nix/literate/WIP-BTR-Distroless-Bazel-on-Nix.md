### üç¨ Motivation üç¨
- Teams feel use of distroless images are limited!
- Is distroless suitable for binaries that depend on shared dependencies e.g. c/c++ projects?
- Can distroless go beyond minimalism i.e. from minimal size to size that is accounted?
- What is distroless' answer to securing Software Supply Chain?
- Will understanding Bazel help build custom distroless images?
