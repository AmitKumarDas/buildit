### üç¨ Motivation üç¨
- Teams feel use of distroless images are limited!
- Is distroless suitable for binaries that depend on shared dependencies e.g. c/c++ projects?
- Can distroless go beyond minimalism i.e. from minimal size to size that is accounted?
- What is distroless' answer to securing Software Supply Chain?
- Will understanding Bazel help build custom distroless images?

```diff
# rules_docker is used by GCP's distroless to place Debian .debs into an image
# google/go-containerregistry is a Go module to interact with images & tarballs & layouts
# crane is a CLI that uses the above (in the same repo) to do the same stuff from the commandline
# `crane append` adds a layer to an image, entirely in the registry, without pulling the image
# For static binaries "crane append" + "crane push" eliminate the need for "docker build"
# Crane also exposes a good library for docker operations if you want to build custom tooling on top
