# The build step runs in a PURE environment to ensure that builds are REPRODUCIBLE
# -- This means NO INTERNET ACCESS; indeed no access to any files outside the build directory
# -- During the build & install phases, the only commands available are those provided by the Nix stdenv
# -- And the EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES identified in the INPUTS section of the flake
