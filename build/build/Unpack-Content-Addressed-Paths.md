### Quotes
- Benefits of the intensional store at a much lower price
- non-trivial implications (regarding the trust model in particular)
- setting some critical derivations as content-adressed can lead to some substantial build cutoffs
- Output Path Computation:
  - Input Addressed: output path computation done with Derivation data structure as build input
  - Content Addressed: output path computation done with the Produced Store Path
